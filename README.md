## How it works
 
First of all, you need to integrate the Instagram API with your Magento store by using our quick step-by-step guide. Once configured, enable the Login with Instagram button in the backend to display it on all login and registration forms. 
Now your customers have the ability to click the button and only provide their Instagram account login and password to get logged in or create an account.
 
Additionally, this powerful extension provides much more features in addition to logging in option:
* After logging in with Instagram, the plugin automatically retrieves user profile data such as email, birth date, profile photo, gender, and more. Use this reach customer database to effectively run marketing campaigns and offer targeted promotions.
* Personalize the user experience and make them feel more comfortable while shopping on your website - display their Instagram profile photo next to the User Account menu or elsewhere on the website.  
* Help your customers share their good feelings and favorite products with their friends on Instagram. This way you increase your social traffic and sales without much effort!
* Implement social login at checkout so that customers can place orders faster. Tus significantly reduce cart abandonment rates and boost sales.
 
Sign-in and sign-up processes can sometimes be difficult due to numerous required fields with personal data. Also, some customers tend to be suspicious of sharing personal information on new websites. Thatâ€™s why we designed our Instagram Login extension that provides security, ease of use, and a better customer experience. This way, your customers will feel safe when entering their login and password in a familiar Instagram login interface, as well as benefit from this fast and login option.
